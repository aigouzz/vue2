Vue.js is an MIT-licensed open source project. Its ongoing development is made possible thanks to the support by these awesome backers. If you'd like to join them, check out Vue.js' Patreon campaign.

## Intro

Vue.js is a library for building interactive web interfaces. It provides data-reactive components with a simple and flexible API. Core features include:

- [Declarative rendering with a plain JavaScript object based reactivity system](https://vuejs.org/guide/index.html#Declarative-Rendering)
- [Component-oriented development style with tooling support](https://vuejs.org/guide/index.html#Composing-with-Components)
- Lean and extensible core
- [Flexible transition effect system](https://vuejs.org/guide/transitions.html)
- Fast without the need for complex optimization

Note that Vue.js only supports [ES5-compliant browsers](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported). To check out live examples and docs, visit [vuejs.org](https://vuejs.org).
